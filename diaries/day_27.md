Leaving Sarria this morning there were crowds and crowds of new peregrinos. I sang Taylor Swift songs for the guys' entertainment and some older women commented on my singing. We also made bitter comments about the "tourigrinos" and Lawrence got embarrassed and paranoid that this woman overheard him talking about stealing her shell.

The crowds encouraged a faster speed as we overtook them one by one, and we pushed past the first cafés to find some more solitude. Eventually we stopped for some food and to our delight saw Corey and Fynn in the café.

I bought an insufficient amount of food which soon turned out to be a big mistake as an enormous queue developed. Corey and Fynn told us about their long days of hiking and their plan to reach Santiago by the 19th, a couple of days before our intended arrival date. We collected stamps from the café and set off walking with them.

I chatted to Fynn about his upcoming hike on the Bibbulmun Track, including his fear of mice. We also talked about Woody's ice cream blog, Fynn's love of big cities, studying literature and films at school, gender-segregated schools, and Australian history. For the brief time I spoke to Corey, we talked about YouTube and filmmaking.

As a group, we arrived at the 100km mark and took turns having our photo taken. Lawrence and Woody stood on top of it and Lawrence managed to take a photo of Woody with his head missing.

Eventually, we stopped at another café where I had a deconstructed burger. I collected Corey and Fynn's Instagrams, scared I would not see them again. As we headed on the last stretch towards Portomarin, they disappeared ahead of us. We arrived at the liberty bell and lobbed stones in the reservoir before crossing the bridge into the town. We then sat down to make our choice of the various albergues.

Before arriving at our albergue, we said goodbye to Corey and Fynn, hoping to see them the next day. However, Mille, Gaelle and others arrived at our albergue and it became a very sociable evening. Mille's friend Luca cooked carbonara for us and everyone got quite drunk. We played games of Tempel des Schreckens but when others retired to bed Lawrence, Woody, Nils, Gaelle and I continued playing other card games. We ended up going to bed at 11:30pm, our hopes of seeing Corey and Fynn the next day fully abandoned.
