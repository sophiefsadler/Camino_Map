This was the hardest day of the Camino, but the first day in about five where I hadn't struggled emotionally. We set off super early as agreed, walking by the main road in the dark, already spreading out significantly as the situation did not lend itself well to conversation. The path continued by a highway, and I downloaded a new audiobook a friend had recommended me to try. I caught up to Lawrence in a small village but he abandoned me so I ate two pastries on my own before carrying on, a small cat very excited to see me.

When I set off again, I promised to myself not to stop again before 15k. The path continued by the highway and passed through another town where I saw Lawrence in a café, alerted by his stick outside. I considered stealing it as a prank but carried on, later feeling bad for not joining him.

Eventually I saw Nils in a café at around 15k so I stopped to have tortilla with him. We talked about how much we miss our partners. Lawrence joined us and told us how he's planning to leave Spain on the 22nd so he can be in Finland for Laura's graduation party.

Setting off again, we immediately split up and the day began to heat up. I stripped to my crop top. The road finally left the highway and went along other roads, bringing me to cows and cute waterfalls. Finally I stopped in Las Herrerias, the last town before the beginning of the large hill. I got a refreshing drink and did a poo as I knew if I tried to climb the hill without doing so it would not be pleasant. Lawrence joined me briefly and we talked about various health concerns.

I set off up the hill ahead of Lawrence, and after an initial struggle it left the road and went through a shaded area under trees. It was hard going, but the shade enabled me. It didn't take long to get to the first village, where I met all the guys, poured water over my head and refilled my water bottles.

The next section was far harder, winding through fields and not always presenting frequent shade. The guys left me far behind as I struggled through the heat. While pausing in the shade, an older man reached me complaining about the heat, and I offered him water as he wasn't carrying any.

In the next village, I was disheartened by the farm buildings and sat myself under a tree, ready to give up. I watched reels for 20 minutes before realising the guys were only a few hundred metres further up at a café. Joining them, I had an amazing omelette and chorizo sandwich.

After a final very beautiful section, we made it to O Cebreiro, a village with spectacular views in all directions. The albergue was relatively nice, but had showers with no privacy curtains which made me very angry. We made omelettes for dinner and I called Alex. Talking to him made me smile enormously before I became sad once again about how much I missed him.
