When we set off in the morning I could initially barely keep up with the guys. I took lots of videos, trying to savour our final morning of walking.
 
Our first café was the 15km café, supposedly 15km from the end of the Camino though it was actually a little further. I got a good empanada and a good cheesecake. We also saw a cat and a woman who the others called my clone, although I didn't understand the resemblance. She spoke like Kiera Knightley.

Approaching the 10km marker we saw a church where a couple of us got told off for keeping our hats on (which I didn't even know was a rule), and then we saw the real 10km marker where we took photos and the guys hit rocks with the stick, as per usual.

While we walked we reminisced on the entire Camino, reading back through this diary and talking about what happened each day. We also did a full hat rotation where we tried on eachother's hats. I was amazed by how ridiculous one person could look in another's.

Lawrence demanded we stop at an ugly-looking café as he needed a rest, which also turned out to be a campsite. We talked about how Meghan Trainor had hired Chris Olsen to make her relevant again. We also inevitably talked about the end of the Camino and what comes next.

We soon got our first glimpse of Santiago, which felt crazy. People passed us singing our Buen Camino song to us. The approach into Santiago was really long, passing by a pilgrim's monument on the hill (where Lawrence played an unpleasant crisp-related prank on Woody), highways, and then the suburbs. We saw ads for tattoo parlours where you can get a Camino related tattoo. We also saw a flowery sign for Santiago which we took pictures with.

At first it felt weird that we couldn't see the cathedral in advance, but as the apprehension mounted it felt right that it remained hidden to us. At some point we all fell quiet as we walked through the historical centre, hearts pounding as we approached the end of our journey.

We entered the plaza of the cathedral through a tunnel where someone was playing bagpipes, which felt very atmospheric. Arriving in front of the cathedral was anticlimactic, as I expected. We weren't there and then suddenly we were.

Several old people approached us to ask about our journey and, weirdly, to take pictures of us. After taking many of our own pictures we went to find the pilgrim's office and receive our certificates. We were all given our names in Latin, which was least exciting for me (Sophiam) and most exciting for Woody (Silverstrom).

We went to seek our hotel, leaving Nils in a café where he was waiting to meet his girlfriend in order to celebrate the end of our great journey.
