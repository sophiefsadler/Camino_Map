After a couple of days, I said goodbye to Alex at the Madrid train station which made me incredibly sad, before finding my train and boarding for my journey back to Burgos.

When I arrived in Burgos, I felt excited to be walking again but was dismayed that it was 5km to a point where I'd rejoin the Camino near the albergues of Burgos. (You can see on the interactive map the gap between where I left the Camino for the train station and where I rejoined it again.) I immediately felt unsure I'd make it to Hontanas today, where the guys had agreed to meet me after a couple of days of rest, as it was already 10:30am when I began walking. It was cold but my body felt good.

Alex and I messaged a lot in the morning and I felt really upset about being apart after such a nice time in Madrid. All I could think about was how much I missed him and wanted to be together.

The route into Burgos was boring but my spirits were high and I was listening to music which distracted me. I arrived at the more beautiful centre of the city where I rejoined the Camino. It felt strange walking where I knew several of my friends had been only recently, but were now gone. I enjoyed the cathedral and ate my spare pain au chocolat right outside. I found it hard to regulate my temperature.

I was still walking through the parks and outskirts of the city 1hr45 into my walk, and started to feel as though I'd never make it anywhere outside of Burgos. I was waiting for deep thoughts to come, but all I was thinking about was whether I'd catch up with the guys.

Beyond the city, the way became more interesting despite passing by a big motorway. Dropping to a river, I found the graffiti surprisingly aesthetic. It wasn't long until I reached Tardajos, where it again felt weird to know my friends had been only earlier that same morning. I had already been walking for hours, and this is where they had started at 7am.

I hoped for tortilla de patatas but didn't find any, so I carried on to the next town where I overtook another solo female walker, the first pilgrim I'd seen all day. I entered a bar where only two older men were lurking and ordered my food, happy when the other woman came in. Her rest was much briefer than mine but I easily caught her after the caf√© again, despite how much my shoulders were hurting.

Here I really began to feel that I was entering the Meseta. It was rockier than I expected, with more wild green landscapes than manicured orange. My shoulders were screaming as I made my way to the last reasonable town I could stop at before joining my friends. I arrived there at about 5pm and debated whether to continue, though I knew in my heart that I would. I saw that there was a single albergue halfway between my location and theirs, so began to push on knowing I could stop if necessary.

The rain soon began and I got drenched, unable to enjoy the solitude any longer. The land became very flat but it had a feeling as though I was high up and everything was beneath me. I could see many wind turbines in the distance. Despite the miserable conditions, I loved it and thought it was beautiful. I resolved to stop at the albergue halfway.

Unfortunately, on arrival I discovered that it was rundown. I was disappointed as I felt this would've been an amazing adventurous story if I stayed somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Thankfully the rain eased as I sheltered by the albergue, so I pushed on to my friends with renewed hope.

They informed me that dinner was at 7, and I was encouraged that I'd be fed as soon as I arrived. The last hour flew by and I practically sprinted down into Hontanas, one of the most beautiful towns we'd visited. Sadly I never saw the Border Collie my friends had been playing with before my arrival. Nils came to meet me and show me into the albergue and I felt weirdly awkward after not seeing him for only 2 days. When we joined Lawrence and Woody in the restaurant I discovered that they were all tipsy and felt better about my slight awkwardness. Hanna was also there and came to give me a hug!

I managed to check in and shower in time to sleep by 10pm. The room was super cosy and comfortable despite a larger number of people, and lying in bed, I felt myself getting emotional and teary about missing Alex. I don't think I've ever missed him as much as I did in that moment.
