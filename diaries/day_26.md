We got our things ready and then sat while Lawrence had a vending machine coffee and Woody spoke to a guy called Andy. I was irritated because I was super hungry and it was taking ages. When we eventually left, I went straight into the next café and bought two cakes to take with me, which I quickly devoured.

We opted for the shorter route to Sarria but I directed a French school group looking for the other direction. The morning was misty and we ascended on slightly muddy paths between green fields and through tiny villages. We didn't see a single café for the first two hours, making me SO glad I'd eaten the cake.

Eventually we came to a vending machine which two older women were using. They tried to buy a can but it got stuck. I then tried to buy a Mars bar, not realising their wedged can was holding the flap shut. After everyone had tried to smack it several times and tip the vending machine over, I eventually smacked the door with Lawrence's stick and dislodged the can, which made everyone cheer.

Just around the corner we then encountered a hippie couple who had opened their home to pilgrims with a selection of snacks. We watched them playing with their dogs for a while before continuing on.

Much of the scenery was similar, with lots of very long luscious grass, rocky paths, rolling fields and the sound of birds. I felt incredibly grateful and happy to be on the trail, and started thinking about future walks I'd like to do. We approached our first real café, where I got a sandwich and there were squeaky noises to deter birds. We talked about Strava, and our plans for Santiago.

After leaving there, the sun had come out and blown the mist away, though it was still not unpleasantly hot. The paths were much the same as before. I was really happy and just enjoying my own thoughts, including thinking about a book I'd want to write.

It didn't feel like long until we arrived in Sarria at all. This was our shortest day on the Camino and the first one where I really still felt brimming with energy on arrival. While I was still doing my pilgrim chores, I heard the guys talking to Fynn and Corey in the garden. Although sad to miss them, I hope I'll see them in the coming days.

I got super hungry again and Lawrence and I went to the supermarket to get food. When we came back we all made food very early and then watched Jennifer's Body, which Lawrence didn't understand. I felt exhausted and retired to bed.
